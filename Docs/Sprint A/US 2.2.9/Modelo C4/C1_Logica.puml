actor "Shipping Agent Representative" as Rep

package "Port Operations System" {
  [VesselVisitNotifications API]
  [VesselVisitNotification Service]
  [PortContext (Database)]
}

Rep --> [VesselVisitNotifications API] : edit / submit VVN
[VesselVisitNotifications API] --> [VesselVisitNotification Service] : validation + update
[VesselVisitNotification Service] --> [PortContext (Database)] : EF Core persistence

note right
Logical flow:
Representative updates a notification still in progress.
System validates, saves, and optionally transitions it
to "ApprovalPending" or keeps as "InProgress".
end note
